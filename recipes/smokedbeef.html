        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Cook brisket in a crockpot with this wonderful and very easy recipe that's great on those really busy days. The recipe can be increased for a large group or downsized for 2 people. It reminds me of summers in Texas.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds beef brisket</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Prepare brisket rub: Mix paprika, pepper, salt, brown sugar, chili powder, and cumin together in a bowl; rub evenly over brisket. Put brisket in a large, resealable plastic bag; refrigerate for 30 minutes to overnight.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, prepare barbeque sauce: Stir barbeque sauce, water, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke together in the bottom of a slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Remove brisket from the refrigerator and take out of the bag. Lay brisket in sauce in the slow cooker and arrange onions over top.</li>
            <li>Cook on Low until brisket is very tender, 6 to 7 hours.</li>
            <li>Rest brisket 10 minutes before slicing or shredding; serve with sauce from the slow cooker.</li>
        </ol>
